FlaxPDF
=======

FlaxPDF is a fast, nice PDF viewer for the desktop.

Light on dependencies, trimming borders, and aggressive caching are
its major points. Okular and Evince are nice but heavy; and the point
for starting this project, ePDFview, is dead.

EPDFview was nice and light, but lacking in a couple ways:
- no caching, if you wanted to backtrack one page, it reloaded slowly
- no automatic zoom to content/trim

Now with my main PDF viewer being dead, why not build a fresh one with
those two itches scratched?

Requirements
------------

Poppler, LZO, and FLTK 1.3.
